This branch allows you to start the project without maven.
All you have to do this is to clone the repository and do the following:

- Open Eclipse and create a new Java Project with same name as the cloned folder
- Open Project > Properties > Java Build Path. Click on "Classpath" and "Add External JARs". Navigate in the "jars" folder from the cloned repository and add both jar files.

Have fun! :)
